# Encryption and Decryption of AES, RSA, and other modes using Python 

## Objective

This home lab project aimed to establish a strong understanding of Encryption and Decryption. The primary focus of this project was to:
Generate a key with aes as the encryption/decryption algorithm.
Using ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB, and CTR modes to encrypt and decrypt your message.
Introduce errors in your plain text. Perform the encryption and decryption with the 5 operation modes
again. Check how many blocks the errors propagated in each mode. Discuss if the propagations are as
expected.

This hands-on experience was designed to deepen my understanding of how to encrypt and decrypt with the use of different modes and to see the outcome of which modes are better to use.
